# NeuroMHE
Neural Moving Horizon Estimation (NeuroMHE) is an auto-tuning and adaptive optimal estimator. It fuses a neural network with an MHE to realize accurate estimation and fast online adaptation, leveraging the advantages from both advanced machine learning techniques and control-theoretic estimation and control algorithms. The neural network can be trained efficiently from the robot's trajectory tracking errors using reinforcement learning without the need for the ground truth data.
