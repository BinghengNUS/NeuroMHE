# NeuroMHE
Neural Moving Horizon Estimation (NeuroMHE) is an auto-tuning and adaptive optimal estimator. It fuses a nueral network with an MHE to render fast online adaptation to state-dependent noise. The neural network can be efficiently trained from the robot's trajectory tracking errors without the need for the ground truth data.
