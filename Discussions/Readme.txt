Dear readers

For more details on why the terminal Lagrangian multiplier is set to zero by definition, kindly refer to the following renowned reference.
Cox, H., 1964. On the estimation of state variables and parameters for noisy dynamic systems. IEEE Transactions on automatic control, 9(1), pp.5-12.

Thank you
